# A project dedicated to finding Meme Floats for CSGO Skins


## 1: Info

This project includes files that list possible meme floats that can be crafted in CSGO. Currently there is only 1 file, it shows all combinations of 69 and 420. The file contains 3 rows:

1. The first row shows the float value displayed in the game.
2. The second row shows the float value displayed on CSFloat.
3. The third row shows the actual stored value.

NOTE: The last digit of the first 2 rows is always being rounded up if the next digit is between 5-9. So for example if the float displayed in game ends with 0 but the following digit is 5-9 (you can just look at the next row to check), 
the value will be rounded up to 1.
